<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Track Internet provides a simple application to track and log the state of the device's internet connection</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<h3>Mandatory Requirements</h3>
<p>For the application to run:</p>
<ul>
    <li>wifi must be enabled</li>
    <li>SD card inserted</li>
    <li>Permission to access the device's location</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Requirements</h3>
<p>To allow parts of the app to work other fields have to be populated</p>
<ul>
    <li>Too track and record the state of the internet connection a log file name has to be provided</li>
    <li>Too email the log file an email address has to be provided.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Operation</h2>
<h3>Startup</h3>
<p>Without wifi enabled or an sd card the app will not run and will exit immediately with an
    error message. On startup for the first time the app prompts with
    <i>"Allow <b>Track Internet</b> to access this device's location"
    </i>
    If <i>"DENY"</i> is selected, the app immediately exits. If the app is started again the same prompt will appear, ticking
    the
    <i>"Don't ask again"</i>
    check box is ignored, as the app won't run until the <i>"ALLOW"</i> option is selected. Once all the starting requirements are
    satisfied, the app will present the main screen allowing an email address and a log file name to be entered. The email address
    and log file name will be remembered, so there is no need to enter these each time the app is started.
</p>

<h3>Running</h3>
<p>Once running, by tapping the appropriate button the app will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>record outages in the log file</li>
    <li>stop recording outages in the log file</li>
    <li>display outages which have been recorded in the log file</li>
    <li>email the log file to the entered email address</li>
    <li>scan for and display wifi networks</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recording</h3>
<p>When record outages is selected, the app prompts if the existing log file is to be deleted or not.
    Each time the recording of outages is stopped or started a message is written to the log file.
    When recording is started, the model of the device and the android software version is also written to the log file.
    The app records changes to the internet connection by writing the date/time and the state of the internet connection to the log file.
    For the state of the connection, the app writes <i>"internet connected"</i> or <i>"internet disconnected"</i>. If the state changes to
    <i>"connected"</i>, the app writes the type of network connection, typically wifi or mobile data. In the case of a wifi connection,
    the app also records the SSID (wifi network name) and the frequency of the wifi network.
</p>

<h3>Menu</h3>
<p>Via the three dots at the top right hand side of the display that can be made to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>stop recording and quit</li>
    <li>keep recording and quit</li>
    <li>get help, display this information</li>
</ul>
