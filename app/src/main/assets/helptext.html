<p>Track Internet provides a simple application to track and log the state of the device's internet connection</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>For the application to run:</p>
<ul>
    <li>wifi must be enabled</li>
    <li>SD card inserted</li>
    <li>Permission to access the device's location</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Requirements</h3>
<p>To allow parts of the app to work other fields have to be populated</p>
<ul>
    <li>Too track and record the state of the internet connection a log file name has to be provided</li>

</ul>

<h2>Operation</h2>
<p>Without wifi enabled or an sd card the app will not run and will exit immediately with an
    error message. On startup for the first time the user is prompted with
    <i>"Allow <b>Track Internet</b> to access this device's location"
    </i>
    If the user selects <i>"DENY"</i>, the app immediately exits. If the app is started again the same prompt will appear, ticking
    the
    <i>"Don't ask again"</i>
    check box is ignored. The app won't run until the <i>"ALLOW"</i> option is selected. Once all the starting requirements are
    satisfied, the app will present the main screen allowing an email address and a log file name to be entered. The email address
    and log file name will be remembered ach time the app is restarted.
